VSConanPackage

Visual Studio Extension to integrate conanio functionality into an existing vcxproj.

The first task is just to process an existing conanfile.py or whatever and pull the proper dependencies and add them to the include and linker paths.

Future work could include authoring packages, specifying additional dependencies, etc.
